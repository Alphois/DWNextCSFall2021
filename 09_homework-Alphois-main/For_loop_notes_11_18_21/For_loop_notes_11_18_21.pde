//for (Initialize; Condition; Update){
//Code Block;
//}
//designed to create a loop based on a counter*
//initialize=>  <int i = 0> for example 
  //you can declare and initialize within the for loop
    
    //when declared within the for loop, the scope of the var is inside the for loop
      
      //that makes it so that you can use the same variable outside the loop without
      //touching the variable within the for loop

//Condition is a boolean value, usually result of comparison oerator and/or boolean operators.

//Update is code that increments/decrements the "counter"
   
   //Occurs after the Code Block
   
   //you cannot increment/decrement before the code block in a for loop, but you 
   //can in a while loop
   
   //does not have a semicolon
