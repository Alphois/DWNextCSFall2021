//an Array is a  special object designed to store multiple values of the same type
    //in other words, an array cannot store both ints and floats
    //any valid variable tye is a valid array type (this includes primitives and classes)
    //primitives
  //char, int, float, boolean, e.t.c.
      //an Array is a "special object" 
      //its not quite a class hence why its special
          //a.k.a. u dont need to know it

//after making an aray, its size cannot change
int ray[]; 
//Declares ray as an array of ****_____int____**** values
ray=new int[10];
//new because it is technically an object
//MAKE ME ARRAY OF 10 INTS
    //basically ray is empty but it has enough space for 10 values
//ray[i] returns the element in ray and index i. The first element in ray is at index 0
//ray.length returns number of elements in ray
